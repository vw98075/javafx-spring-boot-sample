# Spring Boot & JavaFX Sample 

This sample project is designed to demonstrate how to use Spring Boot with JavaFX.

It takes a user input text on the JavaFX UI and saves it along with a timestamp to H2 database. The text, timestamp, and the total number of the text entries will be displayed on the UI at the end of the process.

Use the following command at the root directory to run this application:

```./mvnw javafx:run```
